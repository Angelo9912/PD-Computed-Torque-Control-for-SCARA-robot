# PD, Computed Torque and Adaptive Backstepping Control for SCARA robot

Project realized for the "Robot Control" course. 
We implemented 3 kinds of Control:
-- PD control
-- Computed Torque control
-- Adaptive Backstepping

The manipulator chosen is the SCARA robot, with 4DOF: 3 revolute joints
and 1 prismatic joint.

How to use: 
1) run "Inizializzazione_tavole.mlx" script
2) it will displayed on the MATLAB console to choose the controller you want
    (choose 1 for PD, 2 for Computed Torque, 3 for Adaptive Backstepping)
3) run "animazioni.m" to see the animated results

# Controllability and Observability of BlueRov2

Is also presented a study for the observability and the controllability 
of the BlueRov2, a Remotely Operated Vehicle with 4DOF: translational 
movement on the x,y,z axes and only yaw angle.
